## 1. IDENTIFY

### 1.A Asset Inventory
- [ ] Maintain a regularly updated inventory of all IT and OT assets with IP addresses (including IPv6).  
- [ ] Update inventory at least monthly.  
- [ ] Use Cyber Hygiene Services and “Stuff Off Search” guide.  

### 1.B Organizational Cybersecurity Leadership
- [ ] Identify a named role accountable for cybersecurity planning, resourcing, and execution.  
- [ ] Ensure role includes budget/resource authority and strategy leadership.  

### 1.C OT Cybersecurity Leadership
- [ ] Identify role accountable for OT-specific cybersecurity activities.  

### 1.D Improving IT and OT Cybersecurity Relationships
- [ ] Sponsor at least one social event annually to strengthen IT/OT security collaboration.  

### 1.E Mitigating Known Vulnerabilities
- [ ] Patch all KEV catalog vulnerabilities on internet-facing systems within risk-informed timelines.  
- [ ] Apply compensating controls if patching is not possible (segmentation, monitoring).  

### 1.F Third-Party Validation of Controls
- [ ] Engage external experts to validate effectiveness of IT/OT cybersecurity defenses.  
- [ ] Include penetration tests, bug bounties, incident simulations, and table-tops.  
- [ ] Mitigate high-impact findings promptly.  

### 1.G Supply Chain Incident Reporting
- [ ] Require vendors/service providers to notify of incidents in procurement contracts.  

### 1.H Supply Chain Vulnerability Disclosure
- [ ] Require vendors/service providers to notify of confirmed vulnerabilities within agreed timeframe.  

### 1.I Vendor/Supplier Cybersecurity Requirements
- [ ] Include cybersecurity criteria in procurement documents and use them in vendor selection.

## 2. PROTECT

### 2.A Changing Default Passwords
- [ ] Enforce policy requiring default manufacturer passwords changed before deployment.  
- [ ] Document compensating controls where default cannot be changed.  

### 2.B Minimum Password Strength
- [ ] Require minimum password length of 15+ characters.  
- [ ] Use passphrases/password managers.  
- [ ] Apply compensating controls if not technically feasible.  

### 2.C Unique Credentials
- [ ] Ensure all services/accounts use unique credentials.  

### 2.D Revoking Credentials for Departing Employees
- [ ] Revoke badges/tokens and disable all accounts by departure day.  

### 2.E Separating User and Privileged Accounts
- [ ] Require administrators to use separate user and admin accounts.  
- [ ] Revalidate privileges on a recurring basis.  

### 2.F Network Segmentation
- [ ] Deny OT network connections by default; only allow explicitly approved connections.  
- [ ] Route IT/OT communications through controlled intermediaries (firewall, bastion, DMZ).  

### 2.G Detection of Failed Login Attempts
- [ ] Log unsuccessful logins and alert security team after repeated failures.  
- [ ] Lock suspicious accounts per system-enforced policy.  

### 2.H Phishing-Resistant MFA
- [ ] Implement strongest MFA method available (prefer hardware-based, e.g., FIDO).  
- [ ] Apply MFA to all IT accounts, prioritizing privileged accounts.  
- [ ] Require MFA for remotely accessible OT systems.  

### 2.I Basic Cybersecurity Training
- [ ] Conduct annual cybersecurity awareness training for all staff.  
- [ ] Provide training to new employees within 10 days of onboarding.  

### 2.J OT Cybersecurity Training
- [ ] Provide annual OT-specific cybersecurity training for staff managing OT systems.  

### 2.K Strong and Agile Encryption
- [ ] Use up-to-date TLS for data in transit.  
- [ ] Replace outdated encryption algorithms.  
- [ ] Consider post-quantum crypto readiness.  

### 2.L Secure Sensitive Data
- [ ] Store credentials securely (vault/manager).  
- [ ] Prohibit plaintext storage of sensitive data.  

### 2.M Email Security
- [ ] Enable STARTTLS, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC (reject).  

### 2.N Disable Macros by Default
- [ ] Enforce disabling of Office macros by default; exceptions must be documented.  

### 2.O Document Device Configurations
- [ ] Maintain baseline and current configuration documentation of IT/OT assets.  
- [ ] Review and update regularly.  

### 2.P Document Network Topology
- [ ] Maintain accurate IT/OT network diagrams; review/update regularly.  

### 2.Q Hardware & Software Approval Process
- [ ] Implement approval process for new hardware/software deployments.  
- [ ] Maintain allowlist of approved versions.  

### 2.R System Backups
- [ ] Perform and test backups at least annually.  
- [ ] Store backups separately; include OT configs, PLC logic, drawings, tools.  

### 2.S Incident Response Plans
- [ ] Maintain and annually test IT/OT IR plans.  
- [ ] Update IR plans after incidents and exercises.  

### 2.T Log Collection
- [ ] Collect and store access/security logs (firewall, IDS, VPN, etc.).  
- [ ] Collect network traffic for OT assets without logs.  

### 2.U Secure Log Storage
- [ ] Store logs centrally (SIEM/database).  
- [ ] Restrict access and retain per regulatory/risk guidance.  

### 2.V Prohibit Unauthorized Devices
- [ ] Enforce policies prohibiting unauthorized hardware/media.  
- [ ] Secure/remove unused OT physical ports.  

### 2.W No Exploitable Services on Internet
- [ ] Disable unnecessary services on internet-facing assets.  
- [ ] Apply compensating controls where services must be exposed.  

### 2.X Limit OT Connections to Public Internet
- [ ] Prohibit OT assets on public internet unless explicitly required.  
- [ ] Apply additional protections to exceptions.
