# Security Resources

This repository contains curated security resources, templates, and checklists to support organizations in strengthening their cybersecurity posture.  

Included materials provide actionable, standards-aligned practices for IT and OT environments, such as:  

- **CISA Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPG) Checklist** — a structured, web-based checklist version of CISA’s official framework to help track implementation of key security controls.  
- **Issue Templates** for GitHub — enabling teams to operationalize security checklists directly in project workflows.  
- **Supporting References** to free services, guidance, and tools from CISA and other trusted sources.  

The goal of this repository is to make it easier to adopt practical, repeatable, and measurable security practices across diverse organizations. Contributions and pull requests to extend or refine these resources are welcome.
